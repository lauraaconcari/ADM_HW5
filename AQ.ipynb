(https://ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/161/960312.html). One of these examples of NP-complete problems is the Set Cover Problem (https://math.mit.edu/~goemans/18434S06/setcover-tamara.pdf), where we have U elements and we need to find the smallest subset of S such taht every element in U is included. In our case, we have a set of skills T, same as to the universe U in the Set Cover problem, and a group of individuals X, each with a subset of these skills, similar to each set in S in the Set Cover problem. Our goal is to find the subset of these individuals such that all skills in T are covered. To show that our problem is NP-hard, we can map each element in the universe U of the Set Cover problem to a skill in T, and each set in S to an individual in X. We therefore assign a weight to the edges between individuals to represent the effort to work together, simplifying the reduction to focus on skill coverage. If we can find a subset of individuals X′ that covers all skills with the minimized sum of edge weights, we effectively solve the Set Cover, demonstrating that out problem is at least as hard as the Set Cover problem, confirming that our problem is NP-hard.\n",
